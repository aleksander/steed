//! Platform-dependent platform abstraction
//!
//! The `std::sys` module is the abstracted interface through which
//! `std` talks to the underlying operating system. It has different
//! implementations for different operating system families, today
//! just Unix and Windows.
//!
//! The centralization of platform-specific code in this module is
//! enforced by the "platform abstraction layer" tidy script in
//! `tools/tidy/pal.rs`.
//!
//! This module is closely related to the platform-independent system
//! integration code in `std::sys_common`. See that module's
//! documentation for details.
//!
//! In the future it would be desirable for the indepedent
//! implementations of this module to be extracted to their own crates
//! that `std` can link to, thus enabling their implementation
//! out-of-tree via crate replacement. Though due to the complex
//! inter-dependencies within `std` that will be a challenging goal to
//! achieve.
